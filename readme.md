I kind of cheated (googled and found this in the code academy ruby materials), but it's pretty awesome. I worked my way through the lesson, and am definitely planning on doing more of those tutorials.

BUT--still wasn't able to figure out how to ask it to tell me which word is used the most...so I'll keep working. On the right track though?
